               <p> <b>Viruses have many diffrent reasons for being created and sent out. Though it seems to be the majority of these reasons are malicious and "for the heck of it", because their creators have too much time on their hands. We can also assume they are paid for by some because someone may need it for data collection or influence. Regardless most viruses need a base of code and multiple code languages layed above to be effective; this way whatever targeted terminal will receive the same effects of the virus.</b></p>
